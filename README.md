# SimWork: The Future of Work Simulation Platform

![SimWork Logo](./public/logo.svg)

SimWork is an AI-driven, immersive "future of work" game that combines real-world tasks with adaptive difficulty, OCR-enabled asset submission, and real-time analytics. Our platform addresses critical gaps in corporate and educational training by delivering engaging, cost-effective, and retention-focused simulations.

## üöÄ Vision

SimWork transforms how companies hire, train, and evaluate talent by creating an immersive simulation environment that mirrors real workplace challenges. Our platform scales from single learners to enterprise hires, offering both hiring managers and trainees a seamless, data-rich experience that reduces mis-hires and accelerates workforce readiness.

## üéØ Core Problems We Solve

### Wrong Hires, Wasted Money
Companies keep hiring the wrong people‚Äîtime, salary, and training costs wasted. Real candidates also lose out due to bad screening and vague interviews.

### Fake Skills, No Real Test
Many hires pass interviews but fail on the job. There's no hands-on task or live environment to prove they can actually do the daily work‚Äîeven with AI tools.

### Slow, Inefficient Hiring Process
Too many rounds, test sheets, and guesswork. No live data, no real output. Hiring managers waste time when they could just watch candidates solve actual tasks.

### No KPI or Proof of Skill
Current systems don't track real performance. Without real-time KPIs, logs, and session recordings, it's all talk‚Äîno proof.

## üí° Our Solution

### Immersive, Multi-Role Game World
SimWork places users in a 3D office/map with stations for Developer, Designer, PM, Data Entry, and AI Engineer roles. Trainees navigate to desks equipped with real terminals (Cloud VS Code), virtual notebooks, and design tools to complete authentic tasks‚Äîform submissions, code challenges, image design‚Äîthat mirror on-the-job workflows.

### AI-Powered Adaptivity & Agents
Integrated GPT-based agents guide scenarios, perform OCR on designer-submitted assets, and dynamically adjust task complexity. This prevents mis-hires by exposing candidates to true job demands before onboarding.

### Real-Time Analytics & Feedback
A dashboard tracks KPIs (accuracy, speed, decision quality), generates personalized feedback loops, and offers hiring managers live or recorded sessions‚Äîbridging learning and evaluation in one platform.

## üß© Phased Rollout

### Phase 1 (MVP): Web-Based 2.5D Simulation Game
SimWork begins as a web-based 2.5D simulation game where users navigate a stylized office or workspace. Players create a character, explore different departments (e.g., Developer Bay, Design Lab, Data Entry Station), and receive procedurally generated quests tailored to their selected role or skill area.

Each quest mimics a real-world task‚Äîwriting a function, designing a logo, filling out structured forms, debugging AI prompts‚Äîintegrated directly into the simulation interface (e.g., embedded terminals, Figma-style editors, markdown note areas).

#### Key Features:
- 2.5D Interactive Map: Walkable environment with NPCs, stations, and role-based task zones.
- Quest Engine: AI-powered quest system that randomly generates challenges relevant to the user's chosen domain.
- Embedded Tools: Simulated IDE, form inputs, design canvas, and data manipulation tools all within the game.
- Progress Feedback: Basic scoring system based on accuracy, time, and task completion with real-time guidance.

### Future Phases
- Phase 2: Desktop/mobile apps, expanded role scenarios.
- Phase 3: VR/AR integration, multiplayer enterprise modules.
